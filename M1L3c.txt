Now, just as a short example, we want
to discuss the thermal state.
And the thermal state is nothing else
than photons in a black body cavity.
We have a photon field which is in equilibrium
at temperature t.

So, if you use the canonical ensemble
our statistical operator is given
by this well-known expression.
I mean, that's all.
I mean, isn't it wonderful once you are trained
in statistical mechanics.
This is all you have to know about the thermal state
of light.
That's it.
This is the Planck Law.
All we have to do is take the Hamiltonian, which
we have written down upstairs, so this
is e to the minus n photons, n times h by omega
is the energy, over kt, divided by the partition function.

This is the density matrix, a statistical operator
for single node light in thermal equilibrium.

The partition function is very simple
because this sum over all poles [INAUDIBLE] to us
is a geometric series which can be simply summed up
in this way.

Divided by kt.
So.

Therefore, this expression here can
be written as the density matrix in thermal equilibrium.
Can be written in the number basis, and is diagonal,
and the prefector is the probability
to have n photons populated in thermal equilibrium.
And the probability for n photons is given here.
We've evaluated the partition function.
So then if you put it together we simply get this,
you can call it Bose-Einstein factor,
which tells us what is the probability
to find an harmonic oscillator with [INAUDIBLE].
And this is the expression. e the minus h [INAUDIBLE], omega.

So.

This result takes care of many situations, actually almost
all situations you find in everyday life.
Unless you switch on a laser pointer.
So this describes-- and this is the filament.
It describes the light generated by gas discharges.
It describes the light of the sun.
And this kind of thermal light, because it has-- I mean,
light in thermal equilibrium, thermal equilibrium
is maximizing the entropy under the given boundary condition.
It's also called chaotic light.

It's just another name for thermal light.

So, well, you should know, lean back and take the attitude,
if I know the statistical operator of an ensemble
I know everything about it, and every quantity
I'm interested in can be calculated.
So, just as an example, we know what is the probability
to find n photons.

But now we want to ask, what is the energy density, or what
is the mean excitation number?
What is the average of n?
So far that we have to take the number operator a [? deca ?] a,
and perform the trace with the product
of this meta statistical operator.
And this is of course nothing else
than we look for the probability to find n photons,
and this probability is weighted with n.
And what we get is the very simple result.

It's a Bose-Einstein distribution
over the chemical potential of 0.
Which is the familiar distribution.

We can now use the quantity n to re-write
our previous expression for the probability
to find n photons in thermal equilibrium.
It is n bar to the power n, divided by 1 over n bar,
times n plus 1.
So all this should be very familiar to you.
And I'm not doing the final step,
but I could immediately get Planck's Law now.
All I have to use it sum up now, this is a single mode of light.
Single monochromatic light.
All I have to do is to get Planck's Law is
to sum over all modes using the density of modes.

Any question?

We will not be talking a lot in this course
about chaotic and thermal light because we are mainly
interested in the purer form, how atom interacts with light.
And this will be when light is in a more specific state,
not in a thermal ensemble, in a more specific state, which
are number states or coherent states.
But nevertheless, I feel if I don't tell you
a little bit about ordinary light
you will not be able to appreciate quantum light.
So I want to use this example now of a thermal distribution
of light and write down for you in the next 90 seconds
expressions for the fluctuations.
So should know a little bit about what is
the statistic of thermal light.
If you find n photons in a black cavity and you look again,
you see a variance in-- it's the standard deviation
of the photon number square root n, is it [INAUDIBLE],
or is a much larger?
So you should know about that because if will then
make a difference when we talk about the purer
states of light, coherent states states and number states,
free states, and all that.

OK.
So, we want to look now at fluctuations.
Let me just first mention that we have normalized correctly
the probabilities.
What we are interested in now is the fluctuations.
So we want to know the variance.
We want to know what is delta n squared.
And delta n squared is, of course, n square average
minus n average squared.

And we want to find out what is said
for thermal light for chaotic light.
So what we need now is we need an expression--
we have already an expression up there for an average,
and now we need an expression for n square average.
We can get that as follows.
If we take the probability multiplied with n, n minus 1,
sum over.
From this expression, of course, we have now an expression
for n average squared.
The left hand side had n square minus n, multiplied
with the probability.
That actually contains n square average.

Minus n average is 2 n average squared.
So therefore, we have now our expression
for the average of n square, which is 2 n average squared
plus n average.
And therefore--

For thermal light, for chaotic light,
the variance delta n square is n average square plus n average.

So the question is--

If this is our variance, the variance
of thermal light of chaotic light is that.
What you should see immediately is
that it is much more fluctuating than Pearsonian statistics.
If you compare now with Pearsonian statistics,
Pearsonian statistics would have fluctuations
where, well, the arm is fluctuations as square root n,
the variance is just an average.
So thermal light is super Pearsonian.
Has much, much stronger fluctuations
than Pearsonian distribution.
OK.
One question for you.
If you look at the distribution of photons, and we
have written it down here.
Let me just scroll up.
This is the, well, you probably don't have an auto plot
function in your brain.
But if you plot this function, and I'm
asking you what is the most probable photon number
you will find for light in thermal equilibrium.

0.
0.
It is a broad Gaussian centered at 0.
So you have a broad Gaussian.
The average photo number is related
to the reach of the Gaussian.
But the nature of thermal light is
that whenever you look into a black body
cavity and ask, how many-- what is the most probable photo
number for any mode, it is actually 0.
No matter how hot the cavity is and how many photons
you have in it.
The photo number distribution is always a broad Gaussian
with a maximum at 0.
We'll come back to that later when
we talk about coherent states, then
you will appreciate the difference,
but I will be referring back to the result we have just
derived for the photo number distribution.

Let me just take a note.

The most probably n is n equals 0.
