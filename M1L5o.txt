So let's get started on the next unit, which
is fully dedicated to seeing the photons.
So after learning about different aspects
of the electromagnetic field, we now
want to focus on the purest quantum states which
are single photons.
And this unit is definitely motivated
by quantum information processing,
we want to use control over photons
to realize interesting devices.
We talk about beam splitters and phase shifters.
But then we put beam splitters and phase shifters together
to Mach-Zehnder interferometers.
And then eventually, I can show you
how Mach-Zehnder interferometers with a nonlinearity
can be used to realize [INAUDIBLE].
But let me make maybe one general comment here.

This unit here on single photons has actually two purposes.
It tries to give you some fundamentals which are really
necessary to follow recent literature in quantum
information science.
So we introduce some concepts of gates and tools
tables and such.
But for those of you who are maybe
less interested in quantum of information science,
I have to say that, as a more traditional atomic physicist,
I've never worked in quantum information science myself.
I started with atomic molecular spectroscopy
advanced from laser cooling to quantum gases.
I feel that the formalism, using the quantum logic formalism,
is a very elegant way of organizing your thoughts.
So I do feel even for the rest of the world who is not
doing quantum information processing, which
is a pretty big fraction of AMO science in these days,
even for the rest of us to use concepts of quantum logic
and quantum information is a very, very powerful.
So in other words, I would say right now
every atomic physicist should have some knowledge in kind
of what happens to beam splitters, what
happens to single photons when they are manipulating.
And the way, the approach, how we formulate
it using concepts of quantum information processing
is extremely powerful.
Like in sort of quantum mechanics,
you need to know the Schrodinger representation
and the Heisenberg representation.
You can't get away with one.
Similarly, for some aspects of the propagation of quantum
states, you should just use the language of quantum information
processing.
Just sort of to give you already an outlook where I think
everything comes together.
I've taught for 15 years, 20 years about decoherence
in master equation.
And I know how to derive it from general quantum physics,
and I will show you that later in this course.
But then I learned from Professor [INAUDIBLE] one
when I co-taught the course from him
that he could actually make a model for decoherence
by just passing light through many, many beams splitters.
So there is a beam splitter model for decoherence,
which is just beautiful.
You can derive a master equation by just sending light
through many, many beam splitters.
So that taught me something, that actually
those elementary devices for quantum information science
can really act as conceptual models for more complicated,
more general things.
So I've decided now over the last few years
to make quantum information language
an essential ingredient of this course.
But I should say over the last couple of years,
I've de-emphasized some of the more formal algorithmic things.
But I'm focusing on the concepts.
And I think some concepts are really
