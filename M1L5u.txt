We want to now move to what's two-qubit operations.
And then it's getting really interesting.
As you may know, you can do any arbitrary operation
in many qubits by just having single- and two-qubit
operation.
So therefore, once we know how two qubits interact,
how photons in two different qubits interact, we are done.
We have universal quantum gates.

The element I need for two-qubit operation
is the Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

Just a side remark-- I introduce a Mach-Zehnder interferometer
here as a way to manipulate qubits.
On the other hand, most of you know
that interferometers for light and interferometers for atoms
are used for some of the most precise measurements ever done.
So in that sense, this shows the dual use
of the formalism I'm introducing here.
We will use some of the formalism and the language
we develop here for qubit operation
and discuss next week the ultimate accuracy,
the fundamental limits to the accuracy,
you can get in precision measurements
based on interferometry.
So let me just write down the sentence
because it has a lot of keywords in it.
So the dual-rail photon representation
of a qubit-- this is what we have achieved so far.
So this allows us now to discuss interferometers simply
as quantum gates.

What is an interferometer?
An interferometer is you take-- you have in its basic sense,
you have a beam splitter.
You have two paths.
And then you use another bean splitter which
really combines the two beams.
So let me draw two beam splitters.
So these are two beam splitters.
We have an input [INAUDIBLE] b, an input mode a.
They are sort of mixed.
Here are the two arms of the interferometer.
And now we create output modes b prime and a prime.
What we have introduced here is the beam splitter b.
And by putting the dot on the other side,
this is b [INAUDIBLE].
Since b [INAUDIBLE] times b equals 1,
or equals the identity, this interferometer
is doing nothing.
If the photon starts in mode b, it
comes out in the upper mode b.
If it starts in a, it comes out in the mode a.
But of course, this is just the beginning
because we can now introduce here an arbitrary phase shift
phi.
And now it has an interferometer.
Now we can read out with the output
the phase shift, and ultimately with very high precision.
I sort of want you-- that you appreciate
that if we had used single qubits in one mode-- no photon,
one photon-- I gave you many reasons why
we shouldn't do that.
But then we would be dealing with one mode,
and this would actually be something
which involves two qubits.
But since our single-qubit system
is the two-level system where the photon is here and there,
we can now send single photons through the interferometer,
describe the interferometer as a single-qubit operation.
At least that's nice.
It allows us to keep things simple
and discuss things at a very fundamental level.
So what we want to figure out now
out-- we want to figure out what is this interferometer doing.
So we want to know if we have an input state, what
is the output state?
And the input state can now be any arbitrary wave function
in our dual-rail Hilbert space.
So it's always one photon, but it
can be in a random superposition,
in an arbitrary superposition, of states a and b.
Well, with the formalism we have developed now,
it becomes very simple.
All we have to do is we have to act with the first beam
splitter with a phase shifter and with the second beam
splitter onto this state.
And this is nothing else than taking two rotation matrices
and multiplying them.
The beam splitter we have chosen--
I said there was sort of a phase convention
when I picked the beam splitter.
It is a rotation by pi over 2.
This is minus pi over 2.
And the z rotation is by minus phi.
I'm not sure if I managed to do that.
But if this is the y-axis and we start with a qubit,
the first beam splitter rotates it down.
Then the rotation by z does that.
And the second beam splitter rotates by y.
So therefore, the qubit is like that.
So therefore, what I-- if you count all the [? axis ?]
and all the things I did-- is I started with the qubit here,
it went down like this, like this.
So what I did is then the end, I simply
rotated around the x-axis.
If you want, you can multiply the matrices
or you can draw a Bloch sphere visualization
that you say we have an x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis.
So z is vertical.
So we started out with the qubit along the z-axis.
The first one was a rotation around the y-axis.
So then we were here.
The second operation was the rotation around the z-axis.
And then we have to rotate back around the y-axis, which
eventually gives this as the final state.
So ultimately, the product of all this
is a rotation around the x-axis.
So our interferometer-- not sure if you've ever
heard the language, but it's really elegant and powerful.
An interferometer with an arbitrary phase
in this two-level Hilbert space with geometric interpretation
we have given is nothing else than a rotation
around the x-axis.
So therefore, we know immediately
the two limiting cases.
When we rotate by 0, it's sort of balanced.
Output and input are the same because we're not rotating
at all, whereas if we have a phase shift of 180 degrees,
we swap the two modes.
And swapping modes is an inversion of the qubit.
