One reason that you saw that here in the title,
"Bell's Inequality With Two Remote Atomic Qubits,"
those experiments got a lot of attention
because Bell's inequality is something
all physicists talk about.
And when you do it with photons, there
is always the detection loophole.
You don't have perfect photon detectors.
And some people said, well, maybe the violation
of Bell's inequality comes only from the photons we detect.
The undetected photons would make up
for the violation of Bell's inequality,
and Bell's inequality is not violated.
I mean, that almost sounds like that nature wants to fool us.
All the photons team up and say, the photons which are detected
behave very differently from the photons which are not detected.
But these are at least logical loopholes.
And graduate students spend half of their PhD,
or maybe several graduate students
spend their whole PhD, in building such an experiment,
which is now you get a famous paper out of it,
and your research has attention.
So you know, I didn't sleep so much,
so maybe I'm not too serious now.
[LAUGHTER]
But this is great research.
I mean, this is really pushing the limit of our understanding
of quantum physics.
And Chris Monroe is a wonderful physicist,
and we are in the same [INAUDIBLE].
And so anyway.
So if you have a Bell state of atoms--
and I told you how you get it, also,
with the lousy efficiency.
But you get a Bell state.
If you now measure, do a measurement of those Bell
states, and you measure violation of Bell's inequality,
atoms, they don't run away.
You can detect the atoms with 100% probability.
You can shine laser light on them, hundreds, thousands,
millions of photons, until they have scattered enough light
that you know 100% I've detected the atom in this kind of state.
So Bell states with atoms, one, well, real-world application
of them is to test violations of Bell's inequality
