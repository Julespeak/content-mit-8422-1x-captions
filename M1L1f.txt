The other limit is now that we have a weak or shallow lattice
and the news physics, which now comes into play
is that atoms can move around.
They can tunnel from side to side.
So towards the end of the course,
in the last months, proximately week 10,
I will give you a short summary of what some of you
may have already learned in a solid state course,
namely band structure of atoms in optical lattices,
block states, effective mass, et cetera.
This has now become language of atomic physics,
because there is a very clean and straightforward realization
of this physics using cold atoms.
What we are mainly interested in our research
is when we have atoms, which tunnel in this optical lattice.
And for bosons, if the interactions get strong enough,
the Bose-Einstein condensate is destroyed.
And what forms is an Mott insulator.
This is a phase transition.
And for fermions, we have crossover
from a metal to a fermionic Mott insulator.
And with that, we are already overlapping, conceptually
with condensed metaphysics.
because the Mott insulator later is
a paradigm, one of these paradigmatic examples
where you understand some deep physics.
It's a paradigm of condensed metaphysics, where you have
only a partially filled band.
Common sense undergraduate textbooks
would say partially filled band.
This means you have a metal.
You have a conductor.
But because of the interaction of the atoms,
the system is an insulator.
So this is-- well, really, the many body physics
