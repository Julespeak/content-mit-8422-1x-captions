Welcome to the first model of 8.422x.
We start this model by formulating
a quantum description of light.
We then use this description to describe skree states
of light and teleportation.
As a next step, we go to the quantum of light, the photon.
It is one discrete photon, the single photon state,
which is the most non-classical form of light,
in stark contrast to electromagnetic waves.
As a next step, we are talking about how light can
be used for quantum etiology.
We discuss the standard quantum limit,
and how they standard quantum limit
can be improved to the Heisenberg limit
by using correlated non-classical states of light.
Eventually, we discuss correlation function,
g2 functions for photons, and discuss the famous Hanbury
Brown-Twiss experiment.
Actually, although with this model is about photons,
atoms have played a major role throughout this model.
It is only through atoms that photons can interact,
that photons can become correlated,
and that photons can be transformed
into non-classical states of light
