I want to go through four different views
of the same physics, but you will recognize
that they are interrelated.
The first one, just to repeat that,
is if you have light which has Gaussian intensity
fluctuations-- light from random sources.
I think if you would look at the twinkle of starlight,
if you look at the light from a light bulb,
because of the central limit theorem,
you will find that the electric field has
a Gaussian distribution and the intensity
an exponential distribution.
And if you then ask what is g2 of zero,
you find it's two, because for an exponential distribution
average of this squared intensity
is two times the average of the intensity squared.

Before I forget it, one student asked me after class,
I'm discussing g2 of zero, but what about g2 of tau.
Well, my understanding is that almost all of the physics
is in g2 of zero, and there is a simple number, one or two,
in those special cases.
What happens is if you have completely independent sources,
if you have completely independent statistics,
then the probability of finding a second particle
or second photon is independent of the first.
So that means g2 of tau would be unity.
This is the case for an uncorrelated system.
But if you have g2 of zero which is higher,
this means correlation.
This means some form of coherence,
and usually the correlated value simply
decays to the uncorrelated value with the characteristic
coherence time.
And this characteristic coherence time
can be inhomogeneous, technical.
It can be limited by the Fourier transform of a light pulse,
the monochromaticity, the bend which
delta omega is one over tau.
So it has all the usual suspects for what
limits the coherence time.
So therefore, in general, we're not
learning something fundamental in looking in g2 of tau.
We are just learning the usual spiel about correlation times
and coherence times.
The second angle I gave you with wave interference
is something that is deeply insightful.
It shows you the following.
If you have the plane wave, the intensity is constant.
If you have two plane waves which interfere,
you create density fluctuations, because the interference
pattern can be constructive and can be destructive.
So therefore, if the intensity fluctuates,
then i square average is no longer i average square.
And what happens is because of the nature of interference,
because the average of cosine square kx is-- well,
the factors of one half and two, which does come out
of cosine and sine square function,
you get exactly g2 of two.
But that should already tell you something,
which will be important for Bose quantum particles
and light and the classical limit.
The moment you have light or particles in one single mode,
you can't have any form of interference.
Only two modes can interfere, and you will always
get a g2 function of one.
But we'll come to that in a second.
Any questions at that point?
Yes?
I thought that when we talked about g2 functions
several weeks ago, you said that if we
had a single-mode thermal light it
would have a g2 function of two and that all
we were using for lasers, when we use them in experiments,
is the fact that it's single-mode,
not the coherence in the g2 function.

That's a good point, Cody.
I'll just try to connect the two pictures.
I have to think about it.
That's a really good question.
Right now I would quickly say in thermal equilibrium--
I'll give you a partial answer, and I'll think about it.
I'll give you a full answer on Friday
at the beginning of the next class.
I think it would be calculated where the thermal fluctuations
in the intensity and the intensity
fluctuations, and those intensity fluctuations
result in a g2 function of two.
That's correct.

Maybe what I want to say here is if we have two modes which
have all maybe single occupation or constant occupation
and they interfere, then they create a spatial interference
pattern if the phase between the two modes is random,
which gives rise to additional fluctuation.
So most likely, the two fluctuations are independent.
One is the fluctuations because of the interference
of two modes.
But when I say it is single-mode and has a g2 function of one,
I meant actually a single-mode with constant amplitude.
I'll double-check and give you a more complete answer on Friday.
Other questions?
