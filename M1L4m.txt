The language we have used, the methods we have introduced,
can now be used to something which
is really cool, teleportation.
So I want to show you how balanced homodyne
detection quadriture measurement and displacement
operator can be put together to generalize
a scheme, which is a scheme for teleporting quantum states.
So this is an application of squeezing, homodyning,
and all that.
Teleportation of light.
Let me just illustrate what the problem is.
What I want to explain to you here
is the physical concepts behind teleportation
and the crucial steps to realize teleportation.
So first what is teleportation?
Well teleportation has a sender and a receiver,
which in quantum information science
are called Alice and Bob.
And teleportation means Alice has a quantum state of psi.
And she wants to send this quantum state psi to Bob.
In other words, you have maybe some squeezed light.
You have something, a quantum state psi,
which is interesting.
And the question is, how can this--
how can Bob create an identical copy of this quantum state
psi that he can sort of walk away with the same quantum
state?

Before you appreciate teleportation
you have to realize what the problem is.

And the problem is really in fundamental properties
of quantum systems, fundamental limitations,
what you can do with the quantum system.
First I have to tell you of what is allowed and what
not in this game.
Teleportation means, of course, you will not take your atom
and your photons in the state of psi,
just propagate them to Bob and [INAUDIBLE] who prepares them.
That's trivial.
I can send any quantum state to you
by transmitting an atom or a laser beam to you,
and you have the same quantum state I had earlier.
This is not teleportation.
This is trivial propagation.
What is meant is that we don't have a quantum channel.
I'm not allowed to send my quantum state to you.
But in teleportation I can do a measurement on the quantum
state, call you up for a classical communication
channel, and tell you the result of my measurement
is such and such.
And then you would say, well, if I have a spin system and I
measure spin up, I call you and say,
my measurement for spin up.
And you create a spin up system.
Isn't that teleportation?
Well the answer is no, because maybe the state I had
was a superposition of spin up and down.
And what I measured is only spin up, and by telling you
it's spin up you would never create a superposition state.
It would just be a spin up state.
So the fact is that if I do a measurement on my quantum state
and report my results to you, you
have insufficient information because
a projective measurement on a quantum state
inevitably leads to loss of information.
And measurement on a single quantum state
does not create enough information
to recreate the quantum state.

Of course, there is an obvious solution.
When you want to obtain information about a quantum
state we often-- in quantum mechanics,
we have to do many measurements.
And we can take a spin state.
We can measure, what is its X?
What is its Y?
What is it's c component of the spin?
We can completely characterize the spin state.
And then we know everything about it.
But the problem is we have only one quantum state,
and we can't do repeated measurements.
Then you would say, well, the next thing is, why don't you
just take your quantum state and xerox it,
make many, many copies.
And then you have an ensemble.
And you can take as many measurements you want.
You can do an X measurement, P measurement.
I mean, you can reconstruct the complete wave function.
You can measure with an X basis, you
can measure with a momentum basis.
You can collect all information.
But the problem is-- otherwise the whole teleportation
would not be an issue at all-- there is a no cloning for them.
You cannot duplicate a quantum state.
So if you have an atom in a certain quantum
state and another atom, it is quantum mechanically forbidden.
There is no unitary transformation,
no way of creating a situation that you
have one unknown quantum state, plus another atom
or another light beam, and after some interaction
you have two times the same quantum state.
You cannot clone.

So therefore, based on all that, we cannot clone the quantum
state.
We are only left with the one copy of the quantum
state, which Alice has.
Alice is not allowed to send it to Bob.
Maybe Bob is on the other side of the ocean
or on another planet.
All what Alice can do is, she can do one measurement
and tell Bob, this is my measurement.
So this is the problem of teleportation.
How is that possible?
Well, the way how I put it it seems impossible,
but there is a way out of it.
What I've just said is, to perform
a single measurement is not enough information,
so this is not enough.
So we need one more resource.
And the resource which is now used to realize quantum--
to use a quantum teleportation is
that you take some entangled system,
or-- and this is why I talk about it today-- or squeezed
light, which is also-- that's the same thing.
It's a form of entanglement.
I told you that when we generate squeezed
light with the parametric down conversion
the parametric down conversion creates-- takes a green photon
and creates two identical infrared photons.
Until now we have discussed that those identical infrared
photons go into the same world, which is squeezed,
but now a slight extension of this concepts
would mean-- in parametric down conversion
you squeeze something, but one photon goes to Alice,
one photon goes to Bob.
So now Alice and Bob have an additional resource.
They sort of own, each of them, half of the two twin brothers,
which are the photons created in the parametric down conversion
process.

And that will work.
So the idea is the following, to create
those twin beams or photons is simply
done with an optical parametric oscillator.
That is one extension, which is described on the [INAUDIBLE]
here.
I won't have time to explain it to you,
but it's a two mode or [INAUDIBLE].
It puts the two identical photons not in the same beam
as we did before.
We had p a dagger squared A square operator.
They go into different modes.
And now there's-- you know, magic of beam spinners by now.
But now two beams come out, one goes to Alice one goes to Bob.
And now if Alice were to take her input state,
this unknown state which is handed
to her by Victor-- somebody else who participates in the game.
So now we know already that if Alice
would perform a measurement, the quantum state
would be destroyed.
The result of the measurement-- let's talk about spin one half,
would only be one spin projection.
It's not enough to-- it's not enough to reproduce a state.
But what she is doing is she uses again
the magic of the beam spinner.
So one of those twin brother photons
is now mixed with the unknown quantum
state at the beam splitter.
And the output of the beam splitter
is now entering that balanced homodyne
detection, which was discussed.
So the output of this beam speed and the two outputs,
both of them is now becoming part of a balanced homodyne
measurement, and you see the ingredients.
So this and this will be measured.
The other input for the balanced homodyne
is a strong local oscillator.
And the face of the local oscillator
is chosen in one case that you measure
or the X or A1 quadrature component,
or the P or the A2 component.
So now what Alice has done is, by using
this balanced homodyning she has with his local oscillator,
has actually now performed two measurements.
The quantum state is destroyed, but her or she gets an X-value,
and he or she gets a p-value.

So how the magic works out it's really
just a few lines of mathematics no is, this
was sort of twin brothers, but it
wasn't clear in which quantum state the twin brothers are.
Of so if you write it down, and I
can show you the formula in a moment,
these were twin brothers, but those twin brothers-- this
is brother one, this is a brother
two-- are in a linear-- are in sort of a continuum of states.
And when Alice would measure that this twin brother is
in state peak X, that would be a projective measurement.
And Bob's twin brother would know be certainty
also be in the state X. So therefore,
what happens is the measurement of X and P is now producing--
is now through the measurement process--
putting the other photon, or the other beam,
the other twin brother, into a specific quantum state.

And if you look for a few lines of math
the magic is that the quantum state which, is now here
with Bob, turns out to be a displaced copy--
a displaced copy of the original state.
And the displacement depends on X and P.
So if Alice now tells Bob, hey, I measured X and P.
And Bob is now broken in his displacement operator--
remember displacement operator is nothing else
than a beam splitter-- an unbalanced beam
splitter with a huge local oscillator as an input.
So if Bob is now setting up his displacement operator
based on-- makes a displacement which depends on X and P.
He can takes this other twin brother, shift it back,
and he will essentially regenerate the quantum
state which Alice had.
So this is now how a quantum state can be transmitted
without having any quantum channel for transmission,
you're not propagating the quantum state.
Use classical communication, but the resource you use
is some EPR pairs, or squeezed light.

It's a few lines of equations, but I don't have time
to go through it.
They're really annotated, innovated.
I think it will be an enjoyful reading for you.
