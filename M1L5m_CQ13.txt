I'm wondering by going through these examples
if I would ask you that the shoot noise, which
is square root n in the fields and n in the variance.
After looking at the beam splitter and the modes which
are involved, how would you now answer this question?
Is the short noise related to quantum measurement?
Is it related to quantum fields?
Both or none?
