If you think I'm focusing a lot on one quantity, g2 of zero,
that's correct.
But I have to tell you, I have been
involved in so many discussions with people
who looked at g2 of zero with Bose-Einstein condensates.
When Bose-Einstein condensates in hydrogen
were rediscovered here at MIT by Dan Kleppner and Tom Greytak
and collaborators, there was some mystery about, in essence,
the g2 of zero function.
So a lot of physics actually goes into it,
and I've learned a lot from my own research
and for discussions.
And in this unit I want to summarize it.
So the confusion sometimes comes because people
use classical pictures, quantum pictures,
and they may not see the relation.
