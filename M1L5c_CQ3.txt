OK.
Next question.
What features are unique to non-classical light?
And non-classical light means, well, we
have discussed non-classical lights,
but there are different aspects.
One is the width of the two quadrature components,
the uncertainty of the two quadrature components,
the cosine and sine quadrature component are unequal.
Negative quasi-probabilities.
The correlation function, which is smaller than 1.
And sub-Poissonian statistics.

So I've given you four criteria.
How many of those four are features
which we will not associate with classical light,
only with non-classical light?
